# Reversal-RSIVWAP-Indicator 
Merging of the two indicators (Reversal Signals [LuxAlgo] + RSIVWAP [UnknownUnicorn] and adapting the script from an Indicator to a back-testable strategy
RsiVwap = rsi (vwap (close), Length)
The two base indicators can be found here https://www.tradingview.com/script/d0FZtMLp/ and https://www.tradingview.com/script/qTWl7ZOy-Reversal-Signals-LuxAlgo/

This project initially started when I saw some potential with LuxAlgos Reversal Indicator and wanted to turn it into a strategy to backtest the results. Whilst promising it wasn't a profitable standalone indicator. So after some research, I added the RSI-VWAP as a regime filter and found some pretty good results. I've added a few other parameters for you to play around with.

I've also added webhooks so you are ready to go
